IRC - ​[Internet Relay Chat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is a text-based group communication tool. It is a useful way for a group of people to gather around and discuss a topic, and popular with groups of open source developers.

## Getting connected

If you are new to IRC, the first thing you will need is an [​IRC client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IRC_clients). A popular client for macOS users is ​[Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/).

Once you have your clients, configure it to connect to an IRC server, then join the channels on that server that you are interested in.

## Channels

We are presently using the following IRC channels. All of our channels are on the ​[Freenode](http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml) network.

* #calendarserver - CalendarServer and related projects
* #macosforge - macosforge.org general discussion (infrastructure questions go here)
