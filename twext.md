title: twext Library
---

This is a python module consisting of extensions to the [Twisted Framework](http://twistedmatrix.com/).

## GETTING IT

twext is automatically retrieved by CalendarServer's `bin/develop` script during its dependency resolution phase, and is stored as a sub-project of CalendarServer, along with other externally retrieved dependencies.

Alternatively, use GIT to obtain a working copy of the source code. The following command will check out the latest version of twext:

    git clone https://github.com/apple/ccs-twistedextensions.git

Graphical clients which support GIT are also available, including Apple's â€‹XCode IDE. Consult the documentation for your chosen client for information on how to check out source code.
