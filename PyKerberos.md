PyKerberos Library
==================

PyKerberos is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations. The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire Kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of functions that do what is needed for client/server Kerberos authentication based on [RFC 4559](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt).

## GETTING IT

PyKerberos is automatically retrieved by CalendarServer's `bin/develop` script during its dependency resolution phase, and is stored as a sub-project of CalendarServer, along with other externally retrieved dependencies.

Alternatively, use GIT to obtain a working copy of the source code. The following command will check out the latest version of PyKerberos:

    git clone https://github.com/apple/ccs-pykerberos.git

Graphical clients which support GIT are also available, including Apple's â€‹XCode IDE. Consult the documentation for your chosen client for information on how to check out source code.

## Build

Run:

	python setup.py build

## Testing

You must have a valid Kerberos setup on the test machine and you should ensure that you have valid Kerberos tickets for any client authentication being done (run 'klist' on the command line). Additionally, for the server: it must have been configured as a valid Kerberos service with the Kerbersos server for its realm - this usually requires running kadmin on the server machine to add the principal and generate a keytab entry for it (run 'sudo klist -k' to see the currently available keytab entries).

Make sure that PYTHONPATH includes the appropriate build/lib.xxxx directory. Then run test.py with suitable command line arguments:

	python test.py -u userid -p password -s service

		-u	user id for basic authenticate
		-p	password for basic authenticate
		-s	service principal for GSSAPI authentication (defaults to 'http@host.example.com')

## IMPORTANT

The checkPassword method provided by this library is meant only for testing purposes as it does not offer any protection against possible KDC spoofing. That method should not be used in any production code.

## Python APIs

See kerberos.py.
